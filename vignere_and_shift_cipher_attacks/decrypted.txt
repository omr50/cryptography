Principles of modern cryptography
over the past several decades cryptography has developed into more of a science schemes
are now developed and analyzed in a more systematic manner with the ultimate goal
being to give a rigorous proof that a given construction is secure in order to articulate
such proofs we first need formal definitions that pin down exactly what secure means
such definitions are useful and interesting in their own right as it turns out most
cryptographic proofs rely on currently unproven assumptions about the algorithmic
hardness of certain mathematical problems any such assumptions must be made explicit
and be stated precisely an emphasis on definitions assumptions and proofs distinguishes
modern cryptography from classical cryptography we now discuss these three principles
